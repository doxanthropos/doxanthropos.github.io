## Some useful links grouped by topic (I guess)

## Free Online Full Stack Web Dev Courses

This is a fairly narrow topic. At the moment, I know only two sites that provide a full curriculum from beginner to employable:

- [Free Code Camp][fs0] I am doing this one at the moment (fall 2015).
- [The Odin Project][fs1]

## JavaScript

- [JSbooks - free javascript books][js00]

## Python

- [Learn Python The Hard Way][py01]
- [Learn to Program and Analyze Data with Python)][py02] a specialization on coursera.org. The teacher is Charles Severance from the University of Michigan (mostly called Dr. Chuck online).

## CS 50 (x)

- [CS50 on EDx][cs1]
- [CS50xHelpers][cs2] - "a website built by students of CS50 course to help other students"
- [CS50 on Stackexchange][cs3]
- [CS50 on Reddit][cs4]
- [The Manual for the CS50 Library][cs5]

## The C-Programming Language

- [Learn C The Hard Way][c1]
