Dear Reader,

if you found yourself here, you might ask yourself some questions about this blog. I will try to answer the ones, that are usually answered on pages like this:

My name is Knut Jackowski and I am a philosopher (at least that is what I went to university for), who is learning to code in his spare time. That is what I want to write about here. I have for some years now had an interest in programming languages, especially the functional kind, but have never until now really learned to produce something of any value with it.

This is changing now and this change might find some reflections in the content of this blog, or so I hope.

Because I do not have a single passionate vision for my life, not even for my online life, I started to put the stuff, that I put online in different places:

- You can find my main blog here: [Seeker Of Something..][0].
- Some more artsy stuff will fit nicely into the hands of [Tumblr][1].
