Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, short [SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) is a great book and [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is a great tool for all things about text. So it is only natural to use one with the other and yesterday I stumbled upon this blogpost: [SICP in Emacs](http://jugglingbits.wordpress.com/2009/12/04/sicp-in-emacs/). Sadly I had no idea about how to use or install a book in the info-system. That had to change a bit and the following will be instruction for me in the future, should I forget how to bring the greatest CS-book of the 80ies into one of the greatest programs from the 80ies.

In the search for information on info, I found that there is a lot of documentation missing from my relatively recent Debian install. Most of the more interesting parts on info are int the package "texinfo-doc-nonfree". I suggest to install it on every system, because the [info system](http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/texinfo/html_node/index.html) is very cool and it is very rewarding t read its manual. What I don't understand is the "nonfree" part: should it not be free software as a part of the GNU-project?
So the first step is this:

    sudo apt-get install texinfo-doc-nonfree 

After that, I downloaded the Info-version of SICP, that can be found on the [website of Neil van Dyke](http://www.neilvandyke.org/sicp-texi/).

This file has to be moved to a "info directory". The manual mentioned above expkains how to build one, but I just used the one used by Emacs and gave the file the necessary permissions:

    sudo cp sicp.info.gz /usr/local/share/info/
    sudo chmod 644 /usr/local/share/info/sicp.info.gz 

The rest of the installation is done by "[install-info](http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/texinfo/html_node/Invoking-install_002dinfo.html)":

    sudo install-info /usr/local/share/info/sicp.info.gz /usr/local/share/info/dir

This all of course works primarily on Debian-GNU/Linux, but some good advice for info on Windows seems to be found in this blogpost: http://pchristensen.com/blog/articles/setting-up-and-using-emacs-infomode/

My complete reading setup for SICP now looks like this:

It looks like I am not the only one who likes this technological opportunity [enough to make a screenshot](https://www.flickr.com/photos/redbike/5324820738/in/photostream/)

If you need some convincing, why reading SICP in the first place is a good idea, you might read this article: [Why and how to start your sicp trek](http://hackerretreat.com/why-how-start-sicp/)

As RMS tends to say: "Happy hacking!"
