  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Yes, there is web-audio. What&rsquo;s the point?</h2>

<p>The reason I am writing this blog post is that I want to understand the subject myself, motivated by a course on <a href="https://www.kadenze.com/courses/creative-programming-for-audiovisual-art-i">Creative Programming for Audiovisual Art</a>, tought by Mick Grierson at Goldsmiths University of London. I ran into some technical problems right in the first session, starting with the web platform, that is used for coding in the course eating all my RAM and so basically freezing itself and my entire computer. So I looked into the library that is used in this course (<a href="https://github.com/micknoise/Maxim">Maxim</a>, a c++ library ported to JavaScript, written by Mick Grierson) and tried the examples, provided with the library and got not sound, but error messages. Since I am in no hurry to get through the course (I am only accessing it with the free plan, where I don&rsquo;t get graded anyway), I decided to dig a little deeper into it to understand the issues I am having and to find a way to generate sound that will not freeze my computer or make my browsers complain and work well with the course.</p>

<p>So in this post, I will take a basic look into what the web-audio API is, which libraries look promising to me and maybe even find out what I did wrong with Maxim in the process. At the end I would like to have a couple of working simple examples to show, with different technologies.</p>

<p>Dan Mackinlay wrote about this topic in a <a href="https://livingthing.danmackinlay.name/javascript_audio.html">blog post</a>, that was one of my first finds when looking for clues to web-audio.</p>

<h2>Can I use it?</h2>

<p>As with all modern web technologies one of the first questions might be: Does it even work in my browser? Can I use it for projects that are meant to be seen by the public or will they encounter problems with their browsers or devices?</p>

<p>The short answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The long answer:
In november 2016 it is supported by all major browsers on the desktop, on iOS and on Chrome for Android. The only browsers that do not support web-audio are Opera-Mini and Internet Explorer (<a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=audio-api">source</a>), but who cares about IE anymore.</p>

<p> There are some parts of it that are differing between the browsers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;getUserMedia/Stream API&rdquo; seems to be a part of the web-audio API that is still at least a little problematic, because it is handled differently by the browsers that implement it:
Chrome and Firefox require prefixes: Firefox uses &ldquo;moz&rdquo; and Chrome and Opera use &ldquo;webkit&rdquo; and Chrome can only be called from secure origins.</p>

<h2>How to use it?</h2>

<p>Basically there are two main options: using it directly, with vanilla JavaScript, or using it with the help of a library. The existance of multiple libraries might indicate, that there is a need for one.</p>

<h2>Without library</h2>

<p>This primary documentation is as always of course the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/">specification by the w3c</a>, but it is (because it is a specification and not a tutorial or introduction) not the best read.</p>

<p>Surprisingly (considering that IE does not support web-audio) Microsoft has a good (short) <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/documentation/dev-guide/multimedia/web-Audio/">introduction into the API</a>. It is not really helpful for understanding to create sound, because it focuses on working with audio inputs like sound files or microphone streams, the relevant info for generating sound is in the article about the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn954887%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">OscillatorNode</a>. This is the same with the Mozilla Developer Network on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API">Web Audio</a> and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OscillatorNode">OscillatorNode</a>. While here I am only looking into creating sound, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AnalyserNode">AnalyserNode</a> needs mentioning for later projects, that might include audio visualization. There is a nice example of the OscillatorNode combined with some graphics on MDN called <a href="http://mdn.github.io/violent-theremin/">Violent Theremin</a>.</p>

<p>With this I was able to produce a simple page that plays a sine wave and adjusts the volume with two buttons:</p>

<p><a href="https://doxanthropos.github.io/sketchbook/web-audio/01/">Example 1</a></p>

<p>As you can see in the code or in the mentioned documentation, the AudioContext works with different nodes, that are connected to another, beginning with one or more sources, going through some nodes that do stuff with the signal and then joined into a Destination. A very nice tutorial that goes deep enough to do real stuff is <a href="https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/#toc-volume">Getting Started with Web Audio API</a> by HTML5 Rocks.</p>

<h2>Libraries</h2>

<p>For a list of existing libraries you can go to <a href="https://livingthing.danmackinlay.name/javascript_audio.html">Dan Mackinleays blog post</a>, that I mentioned in the first paragraph. I will look into two that are of interest to me.</p>

<h3><a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound">p5.sound</a></h3>

<p>As the name suggests, this is an addition to <a href="http://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>, a JavaScript library that is a reimagination of the <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing language</a> for creative programming.</p>

<p>The sound library is provided at the website of the p5.js-project and it is also included in the p5-editor. That makes using the library very easy if you are already using p5 for creative programming.</p>

<p>To generate sounds there is also an oscillator object, but the p5.Oscillator combines with it some functions that are part of other nodes in the Web Audio API, for example the <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Oscillator/amp">amp()-method</a> for controlling the amplitude, that not only changes the value of the amplitude, but also takes an optional value for smoothing the transition.</p>

<p><a href="httop://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> has another advantage and that is <a href="http://shiffman.net/">Daniel Shiffman</a>, a professor at NYU, who makes great videos about p5 and processing, that are to be found on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman">his youtube-channel</a>, like this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9MfoKe9GU">long one about sound visualization</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://doxanthropos.github.io/sketchbook/web-audio/02/">Example 2</a></p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/micknoise/Maxim">Maxim</a></h3>

<p>I have not looked into this one yet, which is of course a little stupid, because it is the one used in the course that prompted this excursion.</p>

<h2>Conclusion for today</h2>

<p>It is not that difficult to start generating sounds without any library. The Web Audio API has good documentation and is not very obscure.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago I was inveted to take part in a project, that is going to be a platform for online art. Although I am not a digital artist, at most I want to become one in the course of my studies, I was glad about the invitation and quickly took a look at the <a href="http://mkblv.space/">website of this project</a>. The design was quite unique, featuring elements of a Windows 95 desktop between the presented art and fonts that remind the visitor of the computers of the 80ies or 90ies. At the first visit, I just simply liked the look, probably mostly out of nostalgia and the remembrance of seemingly simpler times, but at the second visit (which was on e newer version, but with similar elements), I started to think more about the choice of design.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last weekend I played through the course &ldquo;<a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/adventures-in-web-animations">Adventures in Web Animations</a>&rdquo; on Codeschool.com. This was my first Codeschool.com course and I mostly took it, because it was the free weekend, I had nothing else to do, being sick and at home, and because web animation was a topic, that I knew not very well.</p>

<p>The lessons have been rather simple, with easy multiple choice questions and very guided coding excercises, but the instructor managed to explain the different parts of animation in great detail. While one cannot expect to learn this topic to the bone in one very short course, I have the impression that I now have a good overview how to animate with css and where to look for helpful resources on the way.</p>

<p>What I really liked was that this course has an accompanying screencast called &ldquo;<a href="https://www.codeschool.com/screencasts/soup-to-bits-adventures-in-web-animations">Soup to Bits: Adventures in Web Animations</a>&rdquo;. Usually I am not that much of a fan of screencasts for learning, but this one hit the right spot: I shows the instructor of the course Alyssa Nicoll together with another Codeschool.com developer Dan Denney working on an example website that is somewhat complete, but as they conclude, missing animations. So you can follow them for around an hour, how they put together the animations an this website, how they make mistakes and debug them, how they come to decide on the specifics of the animations and so on, until the website is ready. And if you really want to try your new skills, you can do the same, because the website they work on is available as a github repository.</p>

<p>These two parts, the course and the screencast, really work well together. The course sets the ground on which it is possible to go through the screencast without explaining everything and the screencast gives some meat the the bones of still dry and untested knowledge from the course.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week was the start of two courses (<a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/creative-coding">Creative Coding on Futurelearn</a> and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/digitalmedia">Creative Programming for Digital Media &amp; Mobile Apps on Coursera.org</a> about creative programming in <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>) and I blogged about them in my <a href="http://doxanthropos.github.io/blog/2014/06/13/blogging-about-processing/">main blog</a>.
Since I have already done some of the assignments some time ago, I focused on some things that I knew about, but did not do so far.</p>

<h2>Creating gifs</h2>

<p>There are basically two simple ways to create gifs from Processing sketches (that&rsquo;s what the single programs are called in the Processing world) and both are explained by <a href="http://www.jeromeherr.space/">Jerome Herr</a> on <a href="http://p5art.tumblr.com/">his Tumblr</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://p5art.tumblr.com/post/98291300538/turning-a-processing-sketch-into-an-animated-gif">Save single frame images and combine them later with other tools</a> or</li>
<li><a href="http://p5art.tumblr.com/post/76979034572/exporting-sketches-as-animated-gifs-in-processing">use a library that creates the gif while the program is running</a>.</li>
</ol>


<p>I tried both and both worked fine, at least in part. I was able to install <a href="http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/">gifsicle</a>, but it would not run properly so I did what anyone would do who already has some experience with <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/index.php">ImageMagick</a>, I used the usual <a href="https://www.tjhsst.edu/~dhyatt/supercomp/n401a.html">convert</a> to do the trick.</p>

<p>I will need some more tries to determine, which method to use more because they seem to have different effects on the speed of execution of the sketches. This doesn&rsquo;t really matter, when the animations are generated by code alone, because the framerate will be the same for the exection as for the gif, but it produces much different output when human interaction is part of the sketch.</p>

<p>So probably there will be more here about <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> in the near future. By the way, the mentioned Tumblr from Jerome also has a <a href="http://p5art.tumblr.com/tutorials">nice list of learning ressources for Processing</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the last weeks, I had some reasons to think about privacy issues and social networks. I stopped using Facebook and began using <a href="https://diasporafoundation.org/">Diaspora*</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/social/">GNU/Social</a> more than before. So when I found a <a href="https://sharetodiaspora.github.io/about/">sharing service</a> earlier today, to share webpages into the Diaspora * <a href="http://the-federation.info/">Federation</a>, I used it as an excuse to get rid of the Twitter button and the Disqus comments and put in the Code to share to Diaspora * .</p>

<p>If you want to do the same, you will find the part of Octopress, that covers the sharing codes in &ldquo;source/_includes/post/sharing.html&rdquo;. Just put in the code from the sharing site and you are good to go:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Diaspora sharing link, without JavaScript</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://sharetodiaspora.github.io/?title=Your title here&amp;url=http://www.example.com/some/path&quot;</span> <span class="na">target=</span><span class="s">&quot;_blank&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://sharetodiaspora.github.io/favicon.png&quot;</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">&quot;border: 0px solid;&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I only changed it a little, of course filling in the template code for the post-title and post-url:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So CS 50 has officially begun. Time to get my computer ready for the work.</p>

<p>The installation and use of the appliance is covered in great detail on the coursepages, so there is no need to describe it here. What I do different is that I plan to work mostly outside of the appliance, because my computer is barely able to run it and it is a pain in the backside to use it for longer periods (It&rsquo;s an old laptop, that wasn&rsquo;t powerful even when it was new.).</p>
