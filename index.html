  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I finished the course &ldquo;<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/responsivedesign">Advanced Styling with Responsive Design</a>&rdquo; on Coursera. It is the fourth course of the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-design">Web Design for Everybody</a>&rdquo; specialization from the University of Michigan and it is taught by Colleen van Lent like the other three courses. Despite the fact, that the technical knowledge this course provides was not all new to me, I think I still have learned a lot.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago I was inveted to take part in a project, that is going to be a platform for online art. Although I am not a digital artist, at most I want to become one in the course of my studies, I was glad about the invitation and quickly took a look at the <a href="http://mkblv.space/">website of this project</a>. The design was quite unique, featuring elements of a Windows 95 desktop between the presented art and fonts that remind the visitor of the computers of the 80ies or 90ies. At the first visit, I just simply liked the look, probably mostly out of nostalgia and the remembrance of seemingly simpler times, but at the second visit (which was on e newer version, but with similar elements), I started to think more about the choice of design.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last weekend I played through the course &ldquo;<a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/adventures-in-web-animations">Adventures in Web Animations</a>&rdquo; on Codeschool.com. This was my first Codeschool.com course and I mostly took it, because it was the free weekend, I had nothing else to do, being sick and at home, and because web animation was a topic, that I knew not very well.</p>

<p>The lessons have been rather simple, with easy multiple choice questions and very guided coding excercises, but the instructor managed to explain the different parts of animation in great detail. While one cannot expect to learn this topic to the bone in one very short course, I have the impression that I now have a good overview how to animate with css and where to look for helpful resources on the way.</p>

<p>What I really liked was that this course has an accompanying screencast called &ldquo;<a href="https://www.codeschool.com/screencasts/soup-to-bits-adventures-in-web-animations">Soup to Bits: Adventures in Web Animations</a>&rdquo;. Usually I am not that much of a fan of screencasts for learning, but this one hit the right spot: I shows the instructor of the course Alyssa Nicoll together with another Codeschool.com developer Dan Denney working on an example website that is somewhat complete, but as they conclude, missing animations. So you can follow them for around an hour, how they put together the animations an this website, how they make mistakes and debug them, how they come to decide on the specifics of the animations and so on, until the website is ready. And if you really want to try your new skills, you can do the same, because the website they work on is available as a github repository.</p>

<p>These two parts, the course and the screencast, really work well together. The course sets the ground on which it is possible to go through the screencast without explaining everything and the screencast gives some meat the the bones of still dry and untested knowledge from the course.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week was the start of two courses (<a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/creative-coding">Creative Coding on Futurelearn</a> and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/digitalmedia">Creative Programming for Digital Media &amp; Mobile Apps on Coursera.org</a> about creative programming in <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>) and I blogged about them in my <a href="http://doxanthropos.github.io/blog/2014/06/13/blogging-about-processing/">main blog</a>.
Since I have already done some of the assignments some time ago, I focused on some things that I knew about, but did not do so far.</p>

<h2>Creating gifs</h2>

<p>There are basically two simple ways to create gifs from Processing sketches (that&rsquo;s what the single programs are called in the Processing world) and both are explained by <a href="http://www.jeromeherr.space/">Jerome Herr</a> on <a href="http://p5art.tumblr.com/">his Tumblr</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://p5art.tumblr.com/post/98291300538/turning-a-processing-sketch-into-an-animated-gif">Save single frame images and combine them later with other tools</a> or</li>
<li><a href="http://p5art.tumblr.com/post/76979034572/exporting-sketches-as-animated-gifs-in-processing">use a library that creates the gif while the program is running</a>.</li>
</ol>


<p>I tried both and both worked fine, at least in part. I was able to install <a href="http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/">gifsicle</a>, but it would not run properly so I did what anyone would do who already has some experience with <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/index.php">ImageMagick</a>, I used the usual <a href="https://www.tjhsst.edu/~dhyatt/supercomp/n401a.html">convert</a> to do the trick.</p>

<p>I will need some more tries to determine, which method to use more because they seem to have different effects on the speed of execution of the sketches. This doesn&rsquo;t really matter, when the animations are generated by code alone, because the framerate will be the same for the exection as for the gif, but it produces much different output when human interaction is part of the sketch.</p>

<p>So probably there will be more here about <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> in the near future. By the way, the mentioned Tumblr from Jerome also has a <a href="http://p5art.tumblr.com/tutorials">nice list of learning ressources for Processing</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the last weeks, I had some reasons to think about privacy issues and social networks. I stopped using Facebook and began using <a href="https://diasporafoundation.org/">Diaspora*</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/social/">GNU/Social</a> more than before. So when I found a <a href="https://sharetodiaspora.github.io/about/">sharing service</a> earlier today, to share webpages into the Diaspora * <a href="http://the-federation.info/">Federation</a>, I used it as an excuse to get rid of the Twitter button and the Disqus comments and put in the Code to share to Diaspora * .</p>

<p>If you want to do the same, you will find the part of Octopress, that covers the sharing codes in &ldquo;source/_includes/post/sharing.html&rdquo;. Just put in the code from the sharing site and you are good to go:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Diaspora sharing link, without JavaScript</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://sharetodiaspora.github.io/?title=Your title here&amp;url=http://www.example.com/some/path&quot;</span> <span class="na">target=</span><span class="s">&quot;_blank&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://sharetodiaspora.github.io/favicon.png&quot;</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">&quot;border: 0px solid;&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I only changed it a little, of course filling in the template code for the post-title and post-url:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Diaspora sharing link with Octopress Tags (diaspora.html)</span> <a href='/downloads/code/diaspora.html'>download</a></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;https://sharetodiaspora.github.io/?title={{ page.title }}&amp;url={{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}&quot;</span> <span class="na">target=</span><span class="s">&quot;_blank&quot;</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">&quot;font-size: 0.85;&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Share on Diaspora<span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://sharetodiaspora.github.io/favicon.png&quot;</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">&quot;border: 0px solid;&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So CS 50 has officially begun. Time to get my computer ready for the work.</p>

<p>The installation and use of the appliance is covered in great detail on the coursepages, so there is no need to describe it here. What I do different is that I plan to work mostly outside of the appliance, because my computer is barely able to run it and it is a pain in the backside to use it for longer periods (It&rsquo;s an old laptop, that wasn&rsquo;t powerful even when it was new.).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some notes about Processing</p>

<h3>Creative Coding MOOC</h3>

<p>Since last week there is a course about creative coding on <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com" title="a mooc provider">Futurelearn</a>, held by John McCormack from the Monash University. It started great and was already very successful in motivating the participants to combine art and programming. The language of choice is <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a>, a Java-based language, that provides easy access to the kind of functions that are usually needed to make art on the computer.</p>

<h4>Showing Processing on the web</h4>

<p>Since art wants to be seen, there is of course a need to have a way of showing the code and its running examples to others. Processing already comes with some ways to do that. You can for example build an android app from your code or a standalone Java-Program. But the way to go, to show something to an audience today qould of course be the web.</p>

<h4>Openprocessing and sketchpad</h4>

<p>Two websites are explicitely dedicated to the cause of showcasing Processing-sketches: <a href="http://www.openprocessing.org/">Openprocessing</a> and <a href="http://sketchpad.cc/">Sketchpad</a>. Both provide not only the possibility to share your existing sketches and show them online, but also to create new ones online.</p>

<h4>Processing.js</h4>

<p>Both these sites use <a href="http://processingjs.org/">Processing.js</a>, a port of the Processing language to Javascript. With Processing.js, it is possible to run sketches in any browser that supports modern web technologies (Javascript, Canvas). So theoretically it is possible, to show sketches on any webpage, not only on the sites that are built to do that. For example on your own website or blog. The pragmatic way to achieve that, would be to embed sketches from Openprocessing or Sketchpad in that site, but why not go the fully self sufficient route?</p>

<h4>simple HTML-page</h4>

<p>There is not much to know, to use Processing on a simple html-page. All the steps are explained on the <a href="http://processingjs.org/articles/p5QuickStart.html">Quick Start Article</a> from Processing.js.
In short: You just put the Prcessing.js file in place, where you store your other Javascripts, load them in the head of your webpage and ten you can add a Canvas element, that loads your sketch.</p>

<h4>Octopress</h4>

<p>But what, if your website is done the hacker way, if it is an <a href="http://octopress.org/">octopress</a> blog on github?</p>

<p>Basically it&rsquo;s the same as using Processing.js on any other html-page.</p>

<h4>Where to put the Processing.js?</h4>

<p>Octopress has a folder named &ldquo;javascripts&rdquo; and that would be where to put the Processing.js file. Of course, you will want to put it in the source/javascripts folder, so that it will not vanish when you rebuild the blog.</p>

<h4>Where is the head of my template?</h4>

<p>Since the Javascript is usually placed in the head-section of a webpage, you need to put the reference to Processing.js into the head.html file that is located in the source/_includes folder in the same place, where you find the other Javascript references. It will look somewhat like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="/javascripts/processing.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h4>Making your sketches a comfortable home</h4>

<p>To have some order in my files, I decided to make a folder with the name &ldquo;processing&rdquo; for all the sketches, that I might want to share with the world. Of course also in the &ldquo;source&rdquo; folder. Now I can put any sketch that I want to include in a blogpost in this folder and load it into a canvas-element, just like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;center&gt;
&lt;canvas data-processing-sources="/processing/tutorial.pde"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is the a sketch from the <a href="http://processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted/">&ldquo;getting started&rdquo; tutorial</a> on the processing site and on this blog it looks like this:</p>

<center>
<canvas data-processing-sources="/processing/tutorial.pde"></canvas>
