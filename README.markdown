## Fragmented Notes

This is the repository of my blog "[Fragmented Notes](http://doxanthropos.github.io/)". What you see here is only the generated HTML and CSS files. If you want to have a look at the internals, you can go to the source of this blog or directly to the project of the blog generator [Octopress](http://octopress.org).

The source can be found in the [source branch](https://github.com/doxanthropos/doxanthropos.github.io/tree/source).
